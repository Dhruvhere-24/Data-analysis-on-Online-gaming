# Data-analysis-on-Online-gaming 

## ðŸ“Œ Overview  
This project analyzes network traffic data from Kaggle:  
[Aggregated Gaming and Video Streaming Traffic for 5G](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ahassanein/aggregated-gaming-and-video-streaming-traffic-for-5g/data).  

We combined multiple datasets (`d1`, `d2`, `d3`) to identify traffic trends, peak usage times, and regional network activity.  

## âœ… Key Analysis & Findings  
### ðŸ”¹ **Data Preprocessing**  
- Merged multiple datasets for a **comprehensive analysis**.  
- Extracted useful features like **date, hour (AM/PM), and region**.  

### ðŸ”¹ **Traffic Trend Analysis**  
- Identified the **busiest hours** using an hourly distribution of network activity.  
- Found that analyzing a single file was **not sufficient** for accurate insights.  

### ðŸ”¹ **Regional & Protocol Insights**  
- Counted and visualized traffic by **region** (e.g., California, Cairo).  
- Examined the most frequently used **network protocols**.  

### ðŸ”¹ **Peak-Hour Analysis**  
- Grouped traffic by **hour (AM/PM format)** to determine peak usage times.  
- Plotted a **bar chart** showing peak network activity.
